# Product Filter App

## Overview

This is a React-based frontend application built as part of the Think41 internship task. It displays a list of products and allows users to filter them based on:

- **Category**
- **Brand**
- **Price Range**

The filters update the product list in real-time using React's state management.

---

##  Features Implemented

- Filter sidebar with multi-select options for **category** and **brand**
- Price range filtering using input controls
- Real-time product list updates based on active filters
- Option to **reset filters** and display all products
- Clear React component structure

---

##  Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Tailwind CSS *(Setup attempted but not functional)*

---

##  Known Issues / Incomplete Parts

- **Tailwind CSS not working**:
  - I encountered CLI issues while trying to initialize Tailwind using `npx tailwindcss init -p`
  - Styling is minimal or missing in the current version
- The logic and components are working correctly, and UI can be easily styled once Tailwind is configured properly
